      <h2>Project 3 - Simple Electric Circuit: LED Flasher</h2>
      <p>Introduce the world of electronics with the LED Flasher project. Learn how to create a basic electric circuit using LEDs, resistors, and a breadboard. Witness the mesmerizing alternate flashing of LEDs as you delve into the fundamental concepts of circuitry and component connectivity.</p>
      <h3>Materials</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Breadboard</li>
        <li>LED's</li>
        <li>Resistors</li>
        <li>Wires</li>
        <li>Battery pack</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Connect a resistor to the positive (longer) leg of an LED.</li>
        <li>Connect the other end of the resistor to a point on the breadboard.</li>
        <li>Connect the negative (shorter) leg of the LED to a point on the breadboard.</li>
        <li>Connect the negative leg of the second LED to the same point as the first LED's negative leg.</li>
        <li>Connect the positive leg of the second LED to another resistor, then to the same point as the first LED's positive leg.</li>
        <li>Connect the other end of the second resistor to a point on the breadboard.</li>
        <li>Connect the positive terminal of the battery pack to the free end of the second resistor.</li>
        <li>Connect the negative terminal of the battery pack to a point on the breadboard.</li>
      </ol>
      <h4>Instructions</h4>
      <p>Create a simple circuit that causes two LEDs to flash alternately. When the circuit is powered on, one LED should light up while the other is off. After a moment, the LEDs should switch states. This project introduces the basics of electronic components and circuits.</p>
